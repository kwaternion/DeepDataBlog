### Who am I
<div style="text-align: justify">

I'm [Pawel Wnuk, PhD](http://www.deepdata.com.pl) and I work as a Data Scientist.
My endeavour with data analysis started almost 20 years ago, when I decided that understanding the rules governing the world is something I wish to study. For that reason I studied physics, which gave me though lesson how careful and sceptic one should be when analysing and interpreting the results.  
After that I decided to dive even dipper into the science, thus I started my PhD studies in physics, which I finished with distinctions *summa cum laude*. 
Then for some time I was working as a scientist in various institutes: Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics (Munich, Germany), Warsaw University (Warsaw, Poland), Institute of Physical Chemistry (Warsaw Poland), Ludwig Maximillian University (Munich, Germany), Montana State University (Bozeman, USA), just to name few of them.  

I must admit that working as a scientist is very challenging but from other hand rewarding activity. Moreover, setting up exciting experiments, creating plasma in air or generating hard X-rays with laser can make a lot of fun. Nice example of such joyful activity can be watched on YouTube, where inspired by Star Wars, together with my friend, we made a very nice [movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNTZ7MY2rl8), demonstrating how indeed a strong laser pulse (with terawatt power, i.e. 10e12 W) propagates over the air. So every Star Wars fan now can see how the laser blaster actually travels.  

At this same time my focus started to drift towards computers and machine learning. Shortly I bite a hook and get deep dive into Data Science and Machine Learning. Transition from my previous activity into data science was quite smooth, since in both fields precise and the way the data is treated, how you make hypothesis and verify it, and the way you draw conclusions are based on very similar principles. The only difference is in the tools used, but those with some necessary mathematical background with some determination could be efficiently grasped.

### What I do

On daily basis I work as a Data Scientist. My interest is focused on deep understanding of the idea of how and why particular machine learning algorithms work. Through my scientific life I developed a feeling that without feeling of the idea on which you are working you should not expect any spectacular effects.  
Thus, before analysing given topic, I always try to understand the idea or mechanism of how the data was created. Secondly, decision on which tool (algorithm) would be the most appropriate for given task, cannot be decided thoughtfully without deep understanding of the assumptions, limitations and specification of given algorithms. 

### About this blog

This blog is to share with you my personal journey through Data Science quest.
Here I try to describe my thoughts, hints and observations on the tools and algorithms used for Machine Learning, in general.
