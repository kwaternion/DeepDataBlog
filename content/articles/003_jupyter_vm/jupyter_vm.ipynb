    "# Hints \n",
    "### Static IP\n",
    "It is quite tedious to check IP address of your virtual machine. Especially each time you are starting a machine you usually have different external IP. In oder to avoid that complication you can reserve a static IP which can then be assign to any of your instances. You can get static IP in Menu/VPC Networ/External IP address. There you can click \"Reserve static IP\", which could be then attached to your instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as a word of warning, if there is an static IP reserved which is not used (not assigned to any instances), you will be charged for it (0.01$ per hour). But any assigned IP to instances are free of charge, regardless if the instance is running or stopped. You can check status of your IP addresses if they are in sue by running following command **gcloud compute addresses list** in  Google Cloud Platform (command icon in top right corner of console).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy logging to jupyter (without key)\n",
    "The other inconvenience occurring with default configuration is that each time you start jupyter server you need to manually copy address from console and moreover you need to change the beginning address from 127.0.0.1 to external IP address. Those problems could be easily solved by modifying logging method from key to password. \n",
    "To change the logging method, after running server (jupyter-notebook --no-browser --port=7000) in your browser you need to provide jupyter server address **but without key**, like http://35.204.55.33:7000. Then you will see a welcome page, with a section: Setup a Password (like in the image below).\n",
    "<img class=\"img-center\" src=\"../../images/jupyter_vm/jupyter04.png\" style=\"width: 400px\"/>\n",
    "There in the box Token paste a key (letters and numbers), which were provided during jupyter server initialization.\n",
    "Additionally provide your own password in the \"New Password\" box, and then click: Log in and set new password.\n",
    "This way you will establish your own password, which will have to be provided each time you will be logging to jupyter notebook through browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since now IP is static, and in address does not have any unique key, you can bookmark your jupyter server address (like: http://35.204.55.33:7000), and the access it with just single click. This makes a work flow with remote jupyter much smoother and enjoyable."
