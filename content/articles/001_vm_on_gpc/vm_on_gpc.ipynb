    "# Selecting a GPU virtual machine vendor for Machine Learn\n",
    "There are many competing cloud services providers, such as:\n",

    "Really great comparison from GPU computation perspective has been published recently on \n",
    "[**Maximize your GPU dollars**](https://towardsdatascience.com/maximize-your-gpu-dollars-a9133f4e546a), which I strongly recommend for in depth analysis. The general conclusion is that for stand alone virtual machine both AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP for short) offer similar prices. \n",
    "For example CPU instance (2 vCPU, 7.5 GB RAM, 50 GB HDD) - the price is 5 USD for 1 month assuming 1h per day usage (0.16 USD per hour). On the other hand GPU instance with better specification (4 vCPU, 15 GB RAM, 50 GB HDD, GPU Tesla K80) - the price is 21 USD per month (0.66 USD per hour). But when higher computing power of GPU is necessary, the more powerful GPU can be selected such as Tesla P100, then the price rises to 50 USD per month (1.7 USD per hour). Unfortunately, although for the CPU and GPU you are being charged per hour, but storage (HDD or SDD and snapshots) are being charged regardless if the machine is working or stopped. More exact estimations can be found on GCP [calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Different model of cloud instance can be found on [paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/). Beside typical virtual machines offered as a Core product, **papersapace** also offers something called **Gradient**. Gradient offers only an access to instance over *jupyter* notebooks. The advantage is limited configuration (almost to zero, it is ready to work in just 3 minutes), and you are charged only for the time you actually use the instance. No additional costs when the instance is stopped. The prices are affordable, and CPU instance starts from 0.05 USD per hour (1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, 250 SSD). The GPU enabled machines stars from 0.6 USD per hour (Tesla K80, 2 vCPU, 12 GB RAM, 250 GB SSD), and 1.7 USD per hour for better machine (Tesla P100, 4 vCPU, 24 GB RAM, 250 GB SSD), wich are similar to AWS and GCP.\n",
    "The disadvantage of such solution is limited possibilities of installing additional packages, other means of accessing than through jupyter Notebook, or changing instance type between CPU and GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the conclusion from the mentioned article and my own experience with AWS, paperspace, and GCP, my choice was GCP service. There are few reasons of such decision, just to mention few:\n",
    "* competitive prices\n",
    "* simpler maintains than in AWS\n",
    "* 300$ for new users to spent during 1 year!\n",
    "* possibility of modifying instances type (between CPU and GPU)\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to comment the last point. My wish was to find a solution, where I would be able to create an inexpensive virtual machine for general purpose (low price, with simple interface, few vCPU cores, price below 0.1$ per hour). But the most important point is, that from time to time I would like to have GPU computing capabilities, especially for Deep Learning purposes. With GCP (as well as in AWS) I can create a cheap CPU instance, where I would make regular work, and code development and when GPU would be necessary, all I need to do is to stop instance, and then add GPU to its configuration. This way you can have a flexible solution with GPU, for which you will pay only on time slots when it is really needed. "
