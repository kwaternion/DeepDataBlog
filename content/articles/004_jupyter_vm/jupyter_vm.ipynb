    "# Hints \n",
    "### Static IP\n",
    "It is quite tedious to every time check IP address of your virtual machine. Especially each time you are starting a machine you usually get different external IP. In oder to avoid that complication you can reserve a static IP which can then be assign to any of your instances. You can get static IP in **Menu/VPC Networ/External IP address**. There you can click \"Reserve static IP\", which could be then attached to your instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as a word of warning: if there is an static IP reserved which is not used (not assigned to any instances) you will be charged for it (0.01$ per hour). But any assigned IP to instances are free of charge, regardless if the instance is running or stopped. You can check status of your IP addresses if they are in use by running the following command **gcloud compute addresses list** in  Google Cloud Platform console (command icon in top right corner of console).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy logging to jupyter (without key)\n",
    "The other inconvenience occurring with default configuration is that each time you start jupyter server you need to manually copy address from the console and moreover you need to change the beginning of the address from 127.0.0.1 to your external IP address. Those problems could be easily solved by modifying logging method from key to password. \n",
    "To change the logging method, after running server (jupyter-notebook --no-browser --port=7000) in your browser you need to access jupyter notebook **but without the key**, like: http://35.204.55.33:7000. Then you will see a welcome page, with a section: Setup a Password (like in the image below).\n",
    "<img class=\"img-center\" src=\"../../images/jupyter_vm/jupyter04.png\" style=\"width: 400px\"/>\n",
    "There in the box Token paste a key (letters and numbers), which were provided during starting jupyter server.\n",
    "Additionally provide your own password in the \"New Password\" box and then click: Log in and set new password.\n",
    "This way you will establish your own password, which will have to be provided each time you will be logging to jupyter notebook through browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since now your IP is static and the address does not require any unique key, you can bookmark your jupyter server address (like: http://35.204.55.33:7000) and then easily access it with just single click. This makes a work flow with remote jupyter notebook much smoother and enjoyable."
